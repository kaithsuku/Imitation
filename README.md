# Imitation - Encryption & Decryption Program

Inspired by the movie *The Imitation Game* and the work of Alan Turing, **Imitation** is a text-based encryption and decryption program that employs a multi-layered encryption strategy. The tool implements an enhanced Caesar Cipher along with additional scrambling techniques to secure text data.

## Features

- **3-Layer Encryption:** Combines Caesar Cipher, character substitution, and scrambling for robust security.
- **File Encryption/Decryption:** Encrypts and decrypts text files with a user-provided password.
- **Interactive CLI Interface:** Simple console-based interface for user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** DEV C++
- **Operating System:** Windows 95 or higher

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- Processor: Pentium III or higher
- RAM: 32 MB
- Hard Disk: At least 2 GB free space

### Software
- DEV C++ Compiler
- Windows OS (95 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Imitation.git
   ```

2. Open the project in DEV C++ or any compatible IDE.

3. Compile and run the project.

## Usage

### 1. Encrypt a String
- Run the program.
- Select option `1` for Encryption.
- Choose `1` for string encryption.
- Enter the string and password.
- View the encrypted output.

### 2. Encrypt a File
- Place the file to be encrypted as `input.txt` in the project folder.
- Select option `1` for Encryption.
- Choose `2` for file encryption.
- Enter the password.
- Encrypted content will be saved as `output.txt`.

### 3. Decrypt a String
- Run the program.
- Select option `2` for Decryption.
- Choose `1` for string decryption.
- Enter the encrypted string and password.
- View the decrypted output.

### 4. Decrypt a File
- Place the encrypted file as `input.txt` in the project folder.
- Select option `2` for Decryption.
- Choose `2` for file decryption.
- Enter the password.
- Decrypted content will be saved as `output.txt`.

## Limitations

- The program only supports text-based files.
- The password must be at least 4 characters long.
- Large files may result in performance issues due to memory usage.
